This is the user profile UI for Dine With Me. The "book like" left corner button is for users to start editing all the information through a linear questions slide. Or, users can also edit information by directly clicking the certain item on the interface. The right corner button is for users to log in their Facebook account and the system will extract the information from the Facebook to automatically fulfill the profile for users. The part of featured photos allow users to upload 10 images that can show their charateristics. The circle under the featured photos shows the profile protrait of users that will appear on the map. There are four parts of profile information, the basic info, eduction, interests, and recent goals. They are helpful for users to find prospective parters to dine with or to find common topics to talk about during dining. The recent goals part encourages users to keep in touch after dining.

This upper left corner sketch is the UI that when the user's request gets accepted by another user, the post owner can see the information of the person who accepted the request. The rest three are the UI for the find feature after you click a request that you are interested in.

This UI Sketch implements the map API to show the current general location of the user to indicate the location where they are dining. The map functions include zooming in and out of the map and a physical button to return back to the marked current location after browsing the map. On the 1st pane, it shows the location's name and has a text box for the user to describe the dining locationa and their characteristics so the other person can identify them when they arrive. In the 2nd pane, the user would see their post marked on the homepage's map where other users will also be able to see their post, the status of their request, and the option to cancel their request.
