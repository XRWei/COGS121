## User Interface
The first interface is the main page after users open the app. The top bar shows the name of the app. The left button at the bottom bar is for searching nearby people who have already posted requests for dining buddies. The right button at the bottom bar allows users to post new requests when there are no post on the map, no desired chocies or they have already found a seat in restaurant. On the main page, also called search page, users are able to check existing requests on the map. The blue location pointer shows the current location of user. There are many labels on the map that shows the available requests, currently including name and the condition of surroundings or themselves. After clicking the "Post Request" button, users are able to post a new request. Name and message are necessary to offer more info for other users. The page will automatically jump to the map page after posting a new request. For this week, we complete the basic framework and skeleton code. Next week, we will add the estimation of distance to the post on the map and make the system to recognize the name of restaurant, and create new pages for the situation when users' requests are accepted by others.
