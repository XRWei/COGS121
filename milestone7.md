# Milestone 7

## Task Assignment

### Ruijia Cheng
Implemented the filter feature of the map.  

### Jessica Yeung
Changed the UI.

### Marie Schneider
Worked on the backend. 

## User Interface
We got some very useful feedbacks from the classmates' comments. One of them was if there were too many users in a small area, the information windows representing each request would be cluttered on the screen. Therefore, we came up with the idea that instead show all information about the requests, we only show the number of seats to represent each request. We also added a seats filter feature to let the user be able to only see their desired seats numbers while further solve the cluttered problem. Other than that, we focused on the re-design of the entire UI of the app, as well as trying to implement a functioning backend. 

### Screenshot 1
We added a draggable pin feature to pin to a location other than the current location. Dragging the pin to a new location will show the requests nearby that pin. All the data are faked at this point.

### Screenshot 4
For example, if the user clicks on 1 seat in the dropdown menu, it will only show the requests with 1 seat avaliable.
